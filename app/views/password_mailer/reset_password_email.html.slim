| Dear #{@user.name},
|
| Someone (hopefully you) has indicated that you cannot remember your password.
| To let you reset your password we have provided a link below that will allow
| you to reset your password.
|
= @reset_link
|
| Alternatively, if your browser window is still open, you can use the following
| confirmation code together with your new password:
|
= @token
|
| It is suggested you reset your password as soon as possible since this is a
| time-limited link (to protect your account).
|
| If you did not request that your password be changed someone must have
| entered your account in the "Forgot password" page on our site. Your account is
| still perfectly safe since you were the only person this message was sent to.
| Simply delete this message and no changes will be made to your account if this
| message was sent in error.
